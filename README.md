  Usage: media-sort [options] targets...

  media-sort categorizes the provided files and directories (targets) by
  moving them into to a structured directory tree, sorting is currently
  performed using TVMaze, OMDB and Google.

  Options:
  --tv-dir, -t           tv series base directory (defaults to current
                         directory)
  --movie-dir, -m        movie base directory (defaults to current directory)
  --tv-template          tv series path template
  --movie-template       movie path template
  --extensions, -e       types of files that should be sorted (default
                         mp4,avi,mkv)
  --concurrency, -c      search concurrency [warning] setting this too high
                         can cause rate-limiting errors (default 6)
  --file-limit, -f       maximum number of files to search (default 1000)
  --recursive, -r        also search through subdirectories
  --dry-run, -d          perform sort but don't actually move any files
  --skip-hidden, -s      skip dot files
  --overwrite, -o        overwrites duplicates
  --overwrite-if-larger  overwrites duplicates if the new file is larger
  --watch, -w            watch the specified directories for changes and
                         re-sort on change
  --watch-delay          delay before next sort after a change (default 3s)
  --help, -h
  --version, -v

  by default, tv series are moved to:
    ./<title> S<season>E<episode>.<ext>
  and movies are moved to:
    ./<title> (<year>).<ext>

  to modify the these paths, you can use the --tv-template and
  --movie-template options. These options describe the new file path for
  tv series and movies using Go template syntax. You can find the
  default values here:
    https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/media-sort/sort#pkg-variables
  and you can view all possible template variables here:
